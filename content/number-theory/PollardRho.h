 * Description: Pollard-rho randomized factorization algorithm. Returns prime
 * factors of a number, in arbitrary order (e.g. 2299 -> \{11, 19, 11\}).
 * Time: $O(n^{1/4})$ gcd calls, less for numbers with small factors.
 * Details: This implementation uses the improvement described here
 * (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollard%27s_rho_algorithm#Variants), where
 * one can accumulate gcd calls by some factor (40 chosen here through
 * exhaustive testing). This improves performance by approximately 6-10x
 * depending on the inputs and speed of gcd. Benchmark found here:
 * (https://ideone.com/nGGD9T)
 *
 * GCD can improved by a factor of 1.75x using Binary GCD
 * (https://lemire.me/blog/2013/12/26/fastest-way-to-compute-the-greatest-common-divisor/).
 * However, with the gcd accumulation the bottleneck moves from the gcd calls
 * to the mod_mul. As GCD only constitutes ~12% of runtime, speeding it up
 * doesn't matter so much.
 *
 * This code can probably be sped up by using a faster mod mul - potentially
 * montgomery reduction on 128 bit integers.
 * Alternatively, one can use a quadratic sieve for an asymptotic improvement,
 * which starts being factor in practice around 1e13.
 *
 * Brent's cycle finding algorithm was tested, but doesn't reduce mod_mul calls
 * significantly.
